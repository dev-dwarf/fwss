a small game made for a secret santa game jam

this was my first time using love2d so the code is wack. 
I had fun though

dependencies:
- love2d
- bun, with love.js installed (for html build)
- butler (for itch.io upload)

build script assumes a structure like
-- parent
  -- fwss (this repo)
  -- builds
